# Polymorphism:
# Polymorphism in object-oriented programming refers to the ability of different objects
# to respond to the same method or function call in different ways. In Python, polymorphism
# is achieved through method overriding, where subclasses can provide their own
# implementations of methods defined in the superclass.
